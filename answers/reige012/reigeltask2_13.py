"""
This program creates a class called WordCount() that takes any filepath as
input using argparse and provides some basic information about the filepath
including the filepath, the filename, the total words in the text, the total
punctutation in the text. Then it gives you the counts for the top 20 most
used words and the top 10 most used punctuations.

*Note to user. You must input the whole file path to make this work.
For example your command line should look like:
In: python reigeltask2_13.py --filepath "entire file path"
I find that dragging the file to the command line works best in windows as it
will automatically deposit the entire path.
